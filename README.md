# Serverless Architecture

## What is Serverless
### Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your operational responsibilities to cloud vendor , increasing your agility and innovation. Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

## why serverless

- No server management is necessary
- Simplified backend code (FaaS)
- Serverless architectures are scalable. With technologies that automatically scale from zero to peak demands, you can           adapt to customer needs faster than ever.
- Quick deployments and updates are possible
- Serverless computing is generally very cost-effective. It significantly reduces server cost (70-90%), because you don’t pay     for idle. With a pay-for-value billing model, you never pay for over-provisioning and your resource utilization is optimized   on your behalf.
- It eliminates server maintenance
- By eliminating operational overhead, your team can release quickly, get feedback, and iterate to get to market faster.
- Build better applications, easier. Serverless applications have built-in service integrations, so you can focus on building     your application instead of configuring it.

## Why not serverless

- Serverless functions mean you’ll be dealing with cold starts.
- Heavier reliance on vendor ecosystems (eg. Node.js 14 is out but vendor is still on Node.js 12)
- A lot of developers don’t know what severless is. And even if they do, it’s a hazy enough concept that applicants can have a     hard time imagining what their job would entail.

## AWS Lambda
### AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume — there is no charge when your code is not running.With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service — all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

## Api Gateway
### APIGateways act as the “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
